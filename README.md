Feelreal VR


Overview
The Feelreal VR is a multisensory mask that's made to attach to an existing VR headset. It implements an olfactory component as well as other tactile sensations, such as water mist, wind, heat, and vibration (haptic feedback).

Usage & Applications
 There are a ton of applications for this technology, though almost all of them are within the realm of entertainment. Video games, aromatherapy, meditation, movies, and mobile applications are best suited for this technology. It can also be used without a headset and controlled on its own via a mobile app! The most useful purpose of this is for aromatherapy/meditation uses outside the virtual reality realm.

The Basics: How it Works
The VR headset can work with any headset, including mobile headsets. It uses Bluetooth or Wifi, and is completely wireless. It utilizes magnetic mounts to attach to the headset and can easily be removed. It includes an ultrasonic ionizing system, micro-coolers, micro-heaters, and haptic motors.

The olfactory component relies on a scent generator which uses replaceable cartridges. It uses the ultrasonic ionizing system and fans to disperse aromas in the mask. The ultrasonic ionizing system is similar to a ultrasonic humidifier or diffuser that can be bought at any retail store. The cartridge can hold 9 aroma capsules, and you can choose from a ton of scents to put into the cartridge!

Why is it a Good Use of VR?
Feelreal may seem a little gimmick-y, but it has the potential to greatly improve our existing VR applications as well as create some new ones that we're sure to love.

Weaknesses
Unfortunately, it does have some weaknesses. Feelreal started development in 2015, when vaping wasn't federally regulated. The FDA now classifies the Feelreal mask as a "vaping device", so the Feelreal team is trying their best to get FDA approved for the release of their project. On top of that, it's pretty expensive since it's meant to be used in conjunction with an already pricey VR headset. In addition, you have to keep paying to use it to buy more aroma capsules, since they will eventually run out. Also, the device's battery life is only 4 hours, although I myself would have trouble using my VR for 4 hours straight so it probably wouldn't die during my  regular play. However, you would have to remember to charge it after any lengthy session to ensure that it will last through the next one as well.

Strengths
The Feelreal team does sell curated aroma sets to go with certain games and movies, which is awesome! Imagine walking through skyrim and smelling flowers, or a campfire. Pretty neat. Feelreal also has a free-to-download SDK that works with Unity and Unreal, so it's easy for developers to integrate the Feelreal technology into their projects!

Sickness Rating
I'd rate the sickness rating about 6-7. Since it's going on top of a VR, it has to have at least the average rating because you'll already experience regular VR usage. However, since the Feelreal mask adds other sensory stimulation along with the VR experience, it's bound to be a little more intense for gamers. On its own, its rating is probably a 1 since it will only diffuse aromas!

Similar Applications & Products
There are several similar products in development, but the one that is the most similar is Vaqso. I've made a table comparing the two.

Conclusion
In conclusion, Feelreal isn't the most top-notch technology VR has to offer at the moment. However, it can greatly enhance the existing VR applications and has the potential to create awesome new ones!
